# Data Platform Project

This repository contains the source code and configuration for a data platform built using open-source components. It's designed to be  robust and flexible, catering to a wide range of data processing and analysis needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure your host system (MacOS) has the following software installed:

- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside isolated environments called containers.
- **Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**: A tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container nodes.
- **Helm**: A package manager for Kubernetes, allowing you to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications.
- **Python 3.8 or higher**: A powerful programming language, essential for running scripts and additional tools in this project.
- **Pip**: A package installer for Python, used to install Python packages.

### Install Commands for MacOS

1. **Install Docker:**

   ```bash
   brew cask install docker
   ```

2. **Install Kind:**

   ```bash
   brew install kind
   ```

3. **Install Helm:**

   ```bash
   brew install helm
   ```

4. **Install Python 3.8+:**

   ```bash
   brew install python@3.8
   ```

   Ensure Python 3.8 is the default version if multiple Python versions are installed:

   ```bash
   brew link --overwrite python@3.8
   ```

5. **Install Pip:**

   Pip is included with Python 3.4 and later. You can ensure it's up to date with:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   ```bash
